						<h2>The Arts</h2>
						
						<p>Perspective matters. The lens through which we choose to see the world matters. Our engagement with art in its many forms—from visual arts and design to the performing arts and humanities — can open our eyes to things we cannot see without it.</p> 
						<p>Transcending physical borders, art opens the mind, fuels the soul and ignites a creative spark in all willing discoverers. At JANUS et Cie, we are driven by this transformative power. For 35 years, we have been harnessing creativity and engineering it into inspired furnishings for gardens and parks, music and art centers, libraries and museums... the surroundings which celebrate the expression of our history, cultures and customs. Explore The Arts with us and enter to win a three-day stay at the Four Seasons in Washington D.C. with two tickets to a concert at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts!</p>

						<h2>Janice Feldman:<span>An Artist Supporting The Arts</span></h2>
						
						<div class="grid_8">
							<p>Janice Feldman, president and CEO of JANUS et Cie, has been a leader in the design industry since the company’s founding 37 years ago. A trained artist and interior designer schooled in graphics arts and industrial design, Feldman is not only a renowned champion of great design, but also a painter, traveler, collector and a long-time supporter of the arts.</p>
		
							<p>Art and design has been a lifelong passion for Feldman, who began painting as a young child. During high school, she trained at Chouinard in a special fine arts program and later, her education took a more formal turn at the Art Center College of Design, now located in Pasadena. After completing her studies, she was able to see more of the world and found travel endlessly inspiring. She has since climbed the Himalayas and tracked chimps in the jungles of Tanzania. Her quest for understanding different cultures has lead Feldman to extended journeys in Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.</p> 
		
							<p>Feldman opened her first JANUS et Cie showroom in the Pacific Design Center in 1978, and has since built JANUS et Cie from the definitive source for site, garden, and lifestyle furnishings into a full-service design resource with extensive and varied collections. Inspired by artists and designers from Neutra, Saarinen and Eames to Matisse, Beaton and Hoffman, Feldman has developed several award-winning collections of her own. Her most recent collection, The Masters Aluminum Series — an exclusive collaboration with Orlando Diaz-Azcuy — is being well received worldwide. Feldman is recognized throughout the industry as a business maverick and innovator of design.</p>
		
							<p>Feldman’s enduring appreciation for travel and fine art has grown into a passion for sharing art with the world. Last year, Feldman published her first art book, Carritos: The Art of Gustavo Sagorsky. She met and befriended Sagorsky during a visit to Israel, where she found herself inspired amidst a thriving art scene seemingly impervious to the constant threat of adversity. Having immersed herself in this tiny country's vibrant lifestyle, so rich in art, music and culture, Feldman found herself committed to sharing this rarely seen aspect of Israel with the rest of the world. To do so, she commissioned the book to showcase Sagorsky's recent work while honoring Israel's powerful impact on the worldwide art community.</p>
							
						</div>
						
						<div class="grid_8">
		
							<p>She desire to enlighten all to the arts is evident within her thriving company as well. JANUS et Cie collaborates with renowned designer leaders such as Paola Navone, Michael Gabellini, Kimberly Sheppard, Michael Vanderbyl and Dirk Wynants to name a few. Their influential creative vision is realized through the company’s design integrity, premium materials and superb craftsmanship in order to bring their award winning designs to homes and public spaces around the world. To further inspire, JANUS et Cie’s new Singapore showroom offers a hand picked array of art and sculpture found in Feldman’s travels around the world.</p>
		
							<p>As a philanthropist, Feldman is a supporter of the Music Empowers Foundation, the American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and the Jerusalem Art Studios, as well as local organizations including The Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Museum of California Design. She is also a longtime member of the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.</p>

					<h2>Between Poetry and Realism</h2>
					
					<h3>Tiempo Collection<br />by Jorge Pensi Design Studio</h3>
